# upload-files-cloudinary-python
A simple application with the intention of showing how to upload your images to an external service such as Cloudinary.

It was developed with technologies such as Python/Flask, HTML, SCSS, to store the data obtained from Cloudinary a database was used, in this case PostgreSQL and to manage the models and migrations, Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate.

## How to run it?

1. Clone this repository on your computer:
```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Remy349/upload-images-cloudinary-python.git

$ cd upload-images-cloudinary-python
```

2. Once inside the repository create and activate a virtual environment:
```Shell
# For Linux
$ python3 -m venv venv
# Now activate the virtual enviroment
$ . venv/bin/activate

# For Windows(py -3 -m venv venv or...)
$ python -m venv venv
# Now activate the virtual enviroment
$ venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the requirements:
```Shell
# For Windows could be just "pip"
(venv) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. You will have to add an ".env" file and in it you will have to add the following values for the necessary environment variables:
```Shell
# .env - Example values

SECRET_KEY=yourownsecretkey
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/database-name
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=yourCloudinaryCLOUD_NAME
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=yourCloudinaryAPI_KEY
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=yourCloudinaryAPI_SECRET
```

To get this data from Cloudinary, you must create your own account, it is very easy to do, I leave you the link:

- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)

5. Now just run the following commands in the terminal to add the tables to the database and run the server:
```Shell
# Adding table models to the database
(venv) $ flask db upgrade

# Run the server
(venv) $ flask run
* Serving Flask app 'application.py'
